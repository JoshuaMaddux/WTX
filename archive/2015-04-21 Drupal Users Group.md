CCS "Computer Science" degree is not accredited by ABET. Whereas the CS Department of Engineering is accredited by ABET. Two entities on one campus cannot use the same name and not both be accredited by ABET so CCS degree must be changed to "Computing" in the summer. Your task should you choose to accept it -- change all occurrence in a Drupal database of "computer science" to "computing" across all kinds of "content".

Discussions:

Presentation: Running multiple, name based virtual hosts with SSL on a single IP address - SAN-SNI  - presentation pdf attached below (Mike F.)
Begin process to drop uc-drupal email list
Mobilegeddon - per Eric Mayes email to UCSB-Web
Basic gist - google will give preference to sites that are mobile friendly
will UCSB folks freak out? - some may
​who is responsible for updating sites?  Website "owner"
Presentation: Boostrap intro (Aaron M.) - this feathered in nicely to the mobilegeddon conversation
Haven't had to dive into anything other than HTML and CSS so far
Responsive and "just works" out of the box
Adaptive Theme (Brian W.) - also feathered in nicely with mobilegeddon
​​Panels, Gpanels, Display Suite supported
Brian uses "responsive menu" because menu blocks break after two levels of hierarchy.
Pantheon/OpenBerkeley/Stanford
Pantheon - no longer has a minimum engagement fee
not platform specific
a copy of it.ucsb.edu is being hosted there for testing
ASU using pantheon for $20/month for site with < 10000 hits
Berkeley and Stanford are pushing standardization of campus websites
UCB "line in the sand" - they have legacy sites up to a certain point.  After that they are standardized
