Will host any code produced directly for/by WTX members here.  Don't expect there to be much.

## wtx
This python utility script provides the ability to:
* generate the next 10 meeting dates (if no arguments are provided)
* generate a meeting template page (if a meeting date is provided on the command line) (ie: `wtx 2018-06-19`).

Designed for python-2.x (tested on 2.7)
