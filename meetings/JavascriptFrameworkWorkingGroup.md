  using codesandbox's new "live" feature and picking up where we left off with the [React Tutorial - Adding Time Travel](https://reactjs.org/tutorial/tutorial.html#adding-time-travel)

  - The [Code Sandbox instance we used](https://codesandbox.io/s/340o588py5)

### Ideas for next seesion:

- Reactify the [dining menus](https://appl.housing.ucsb.edu/menu/day/)
- A simple react app that uses [Kevin's Employee Map API|https://developer.ucsb.edu/apis/employees/employee-map] to translate old and new UCSB employee ids.
  - Send a 9 ppsID num > 8 digit UCPathemployee ID.
  - Eventually to host such an app as well.
  - ability to paste a list of IDs
  - Who is End User: HR Personnel?
- React app to show delivery addresses for dorm residents.(Gary Scott)
